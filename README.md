Thanks Glip/RingCentral team! Yay native dark. However…

## Problem

It is still way to bright! Even during the day, the not-true-black just is too bright for me. Here is my desk at 12:30 with my laptop showing the built-in new theme:

## Solution

Yes, I know. Maybe I am supposed to turn the lights on or something. And, yes, it was rainy/cloudy today, so my basement desk is actually darker than usual. But, still, dark that isn’t black is just too bright. This theme, without changes, makes up for that a little:

## Goals

The goal of this theme is to provide a proper “OLED dark” theme. That is, backgrounds are true black, not grey, with the contrast starkness avoided by making the foreground colors dimmer if anything (to compensate for laptop manufacturers failing to provide backlight settings which are actually dim (this is one of the few things which Lenovo actually does right)).

This theme should be usable even when the interface settings specify light. Since RingeCentral likes to forget its settings, this theme is optimized for use with the default theme. It probably will still work fine if you use the Dark theme, but that is not guaranteed. It is in fact likely to be broken if you use other themes.

## Development

This is a work in progress. If you encounter any bad screens, please find or create an issue. If you can contribute a fix, thanks! Just mind that I might be more picky about quality with other peoples’ work than with my own—I am only human after all x.x. So please continue working with me and thanks for contributing!
