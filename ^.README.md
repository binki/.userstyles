Yes, I know. Maybe I am supposed to turn the lights on or something. And, yes, it was rainy/cloudy today, so my basement desk is actually darker than usual. But, still, dark that isn’t black is just too bright. This theme, without changes, makes up for that a little:

dark theme RingCentral backlog:

* clicking on a notification flashes the message in question really bright white
* user profile icons need to be shaded darker
* https://app.ringcentral.com/welcome is very white
* full chat panel white blink upon clicking a notification which switches rooms.
