Thanks Glip/RingCentral team! Yay native dark. However…

It is still way to bright! Even during the day, the not-true-black just is too bright for me. Here is my desk at 12:30 with my laptop showing the built-in new theme:

Yes, I know. Maybe I am supposed to turn the lights on or something. And, yes, it was rainy/cloudy today, so my basement desk is actually darker than usual. But, still, dark that isn’t black is just too bright. This theme, without changes, makes up for that a little:

dark theme RingCentral backlog:

* A blockquote is still black on white
* the notification bubbles in the chat list are still bright—should be made like the icon bar on the left dark
* clicking on a notification flashes the message in question really bright white
* user profile icons need to be shaded darker
* some things are too bright like the mentions, bookmarks buttons in upper left
* site name (upper left “direct-connex”) too bright
* buttons in top bar are too bright
* mouseover of conversation card buttons is white/too bright
* https://app.ringcentral.com/welcome is very white
* full chat panel white blink upon clicking a notification which switches rooms.
* left panel needs a separator border between content because this theme gives them both a black background (which I want).
