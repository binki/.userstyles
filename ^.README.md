dark theme RingCentral backlog:

* A blockquote is still black on white
* the notification bubbles in the chat list are still bright—should be made like the icon bar on the left dark
* clicking on a notification flashes the message in question really bright white
* user profile icons need to be shaded darker
* some things are too bright like the mentions, bookmarks buttons in upper left
* site name (upper left “direct-connex”) too bright
* buttons in top bar are too bright
* mouseover of conversation card buttons is white/too bright
* https://app.ringcentral.com/welcome is very white
* full chat panel white blink upon clicking a notification which switches rooms.
* left panel needs a separator border between content because this theme gives them both a black background (which I want).
